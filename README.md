# Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise
Description: In this project, map markers are animated to move to follow a bus route. This uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as Mapbox.

How to Run: Go to this [link](https://julbrown.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/) or download the files and open the index.html in your browser of choice.  Make sure all files are in the same folder.

Future improvements: I plan to pull live data from a transit service and show the current bus location, updated every 30 seconds.
